## NOTES

* I had the help of my colleague, Maximilian Bosch, to figure out how to smooth scroll my page, and he explained the process of implementing it to my CSS.

* I utilized the W3 Schools website to help me figure out how to create the four column layout for my contact section.

* I also utilized the W3 Schools to help me figure out how to create buttons and how to link them the different sections of my page.

* I sampled the style.css of the 05-Ins_Responsive-Design to get a starting point of how I wanted my page layout to be, and to remind me how to convert the page to a cell phone layout.
